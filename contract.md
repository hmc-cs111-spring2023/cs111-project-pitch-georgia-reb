## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

I want to get practice writing a parser and compiler, and I want to have fun creating
this DSL. These are two aspects of programming languages that I enjoy, so I want to
gain a deeper understanding and important practice in writing these aspects of programming
languages.

I also am excited to work on a project from start to finish. I find that in school this is
not something that I get to do often because I am often working on sections of projects
in my homework. Therefore, I really like getting to work on final projects and create
something from start to finish.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

Like I mentioned earlier, I want to work on my skills writing parsers and compilers. I have
experience on these both in CS131 and this course, and plan to build on my knowledge from
both courses. I am interested in working on these things because I have previously enjoyed
working on them in CS111 and CS131 homework, and want to fully write my own for my own
project.

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

I plan to spend a similar amount of time on this project as I have been spending weekly
on the homework for this course. If I am in a position where I am making good progress
on the project and have extra time, I will do extra work in that moment. This will allow
me either more free time as courses get more demaning near finals, or give me more
time to add additional features to the project.

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

I plan to work alone.

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

I will continue to do what I have been doing for the other feedback in this course, where
I take time when I am not rushed to go through and provide feedback to my classmates.
Additionally, because we are going to be staying with the same groups, I will take notes
over time on people's projects so that I am prepaired each week to see what progress
they have made on their projects.

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

I would be very proud if I am able to have output that I or my friends could use next
time we want to write up a crochet pattern that we have created!

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

I think an A- for this project would be one that fully works, and has a few additional
features.

I think an A would be the same as an A-, but would also have outstanding documentation
that makes the DSL easy for new users to work with.
