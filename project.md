# Project proposal

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

I have been crocheting for a few years now, and as I have gotten more advanced, I have
run into a frustrating problem. When I am following a crochet pattern and I want to make
changes that are differnet to the pattern, it is difficult to keep track of these changes.
Additionally, when I have created my own crochet patterns, I have really struggled to
keep track of the steps that I have taken. Writing down the steps in my notes app, it gets
confusing very quickly!

These concerns made me think about the greater problems within crochet pattern creation. I
want to help people who are creating crochet patterns, or editing already existing patterns,
to have a smooth process in which they can create documents that contain crochet patterns.
Currently, someone creating a pattern must use a text editor, like Microsoft Word, that is
not created with crochet pattern creation in mind. Then, when someone purchases a crochet
pattern, they typically recieve a PDF. Because PDFs can't be directly edited by the user,
if someone wants to make changes to the crochet pattern, they must keep track of them in
their own notes. When this project comes in to help, someone creating a crochet pattern can
use my crochet markdown language to create beautiful PDF outputs of crochet patterns. This
markdown language will have built in features that enhance the PDF output and create
shortcuts for the crochet pattern creater. Additionally, I hope to add the ability to create
output in a variety of file formats. When the pattern creater publishes their pattern, they
can also upload the crochet markdown file. This means that when someone is using their pattern
and wants to make a slight change, they can download the markdown file and edit it. This
allows the user to easily edit the project with a crochet specific language, and then recompile
the output to a file format like a PDF.

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Crochet pattern creation and editing.

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

The user would interact with the language by directly editing a file written in
the crochet markdown language. There would be documentation provided to the
user for them to understand the rules of this language and how it works. Then,
the user would compile this crochet markdown file to either a regular markdown
file, a PDF, or other file formats (scale will be determined as I make progress
on the project). Because the project domain is focused on creating crochet pattern
files, I think that the markdown format is the most logical format to follow as it
is an easy way to write information to be beautifully formatted for users to visualize.
Then, once this file is created, it can be converted to commonly used languages
and file formats like markdown and PDF files.

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_
